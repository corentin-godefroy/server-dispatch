# Server Dispatch

This is a small workflow that uses the Pelican API to upload specific files to Minecraft or any other server via SFTP.  
All sensitive information is stored in GitHub Secrets.

## Server Secrets

Server secrets are stored as JSON text:

```json
{
  "user": "user_server_1",
  "uuid": "uuid_server_1"
}
```

## Other Secrets

All other secrets are simple text values:

- `HOST` – The server host URL without the port.  
- `PASSWORD` – The SSH password provided on the Pelican web administration page.  
- `CLIENT_API_KEY` – The client token generated by a specific user on Pelican (not the application).  
- `PRIVATE_KEY` – An SSH private key. The corresponding public key should be configured in Pelican to allow the workflow to transfer files to the server.  
- `TOKEN_API` – The API token generated on Pelican (not the client).

Server secrets must be referenced in the `targets` section of the `config.yml` file:
```yml
targets:
  target_name: GITHUB_SECRET # reference to the secret

deploy:
  - source: # file or directory in the GitHub repository. All files under the directory itself (not recursively) are sent to the destination
    destination: # destination directory on the server
    targets: [] # list of target_names to synchronize, separated by coma (",")
```

## Recommendations

- For single files, it is recommended to create a dedicated directory for the specific server.  
- For files that need to be deployed to multiple servers, use a common directory and organize files in a structured tree.  
- Technically, you could place all files in a flat structure, but this is not recommended for maintainability.
