## Server Dispatch
Is a little workflow that use the Pelican API to put specific files on minecraft or whatever server using sftp.
All sensitive informations are stored in github secrets:

Secrets for servers are json text:
```json
{
  "user": "user_server_1",
  "uuid": "uuid_server_1"
}
```
All other secrets are simple text:
- HOST #Host url of the server without port
- PASSWORD #The ssh password given on the Pelican web administration page
- CLIENT_API_KEY #The client token generated by a specific user on Pelican (not application!)
- PRIVATE_KEY #A ssh private key. The public key should be setup on pelican to allow the workflow to communicate files to the server.
- TOKEN_API #The API token generated on Pelican (not client!)
